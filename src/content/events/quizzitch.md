description: "Did you ever while away too much time wondering about pop culture? Did you binge Friends instead of hanging out with your REAL friends, read the history of Old Valyria instead of Indian history, or learnt Harry Potter spells instead of math for- mulas? If you nodded along all the time while reading this, then you're in luck. We come back with a new and revamped version of Gujarat's biggest college pop-culture quiz, Quizzitch - 'You Know Nothing'! Get into your nerdiest mode and start binging so no one can say, 'You know nothing'. "
