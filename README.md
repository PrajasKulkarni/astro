## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |

Notes

for any astro project we want to take fro the github we take use of --template functionality as provided by the astro language.

to create a new astro project run npm (stands for node package manager) create astro@latest ( @latest ) generates newest astro component.

astro sees lives changes in /src folder also in the browser we have acess to astro dev toolbar

keywords:- islands :- A component-based web architecture optimized for content driven websites 

# create a new project with an official example
npm create astro@latest -- --template <example-name>

# create a new project based on a GitHub repository’s main branch
npm create astro@latest -- --template <github-username>/<github-repo>

Astro is the web framework for building # content-driven websites # like blogs, marketing, and e-commerce.
it overall reduces javascript in frontend and also helps the website to have a great SEO.
Most web frameworks focuses on single page applications but astro focuses more multi page application because SPA make the overall difficulty much higher to program but still it is fast. Astro to solve the issue that a multi page application is slow use the server side rendering approach so that the html css is loaded at the server only before it is published.

defination of islands 
The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions […] that can then be “hydrated” on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.
